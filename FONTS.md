# Font Documentation

## Open Source Fonts
Free and open source fonts are included in /static/fonts for use in cloning the repo and
running locally, as well as other static files not part of the CMS media for
[Digital Humanities @ Princeton](https://digitalhumanities.princeton.edu).

These include the glyphicons packaged as part of Bootstrap3.

## Closed Source Fonts
For CDH affiliated developers, we have purchased the LyonText Web Family of Fonts, stored
on our Princeton Google Drive.

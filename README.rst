Python 3.6 / Django 2.2 / Node 10 / PostgreSQL 10
`cdhweb` is a Django+Mezzanine application that powers the CDH website
with custom models for people, events, and projects.

View `software and architecture documentation <https://princeton-cdh.github.io/cdh-web/>`_
for the current release.

This repository uses `git-flow <https://github.com/nvie/gitflow>`_ conventions; main
contains the most recent release, and work in progress will be on the develop branch.
Pull requests should be made against develop.


Development instructions
------------------------

Initial setup and installation:

- Recommended: create and activate a python 3.6 virtualenv::

    virtualenv cdhweb -p python3.6
    source cdhweb/bin/activate

- Use pip to install required python dependencies.  To install production
  dependencies only::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

  To install all development requirements::

    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt

- Install django-compressor dependencies::

    npm install

- Copy sample local settings and configure for your environment::

    cp cdhweb/local_settings.py.sample cdhweb/local_settings.py

Remember to add a ``SECRET_KEY`` setting!

- Download licensed fonts and install locally under /sitemedia/fonts/

- If running this application on MariaDB/MySQL, you must make sure that
  time zone definitions are installed. On most flavors of Linux/MacOS,
  you may use the following command, which will prompt
  for the database server's root password::

    mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -u root mysql -p

  If this command does not work, make sure you have the command line utilities
  for MariaDB/MySQL installed and consult the documentation for your OS for
  timezone info. Windows users will need to install a copy of the zoneinfo
  files.

  See `MariaDB <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/mysql_tzinfo_to_sql/>`_'s
  info on the utility for more information.

- Install OpenCV dependencies (if necessary) for `wagtail image feature detection <https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/advanced_topics/images/feature_detection.html>`_

Setup pre-commit hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you plan to contribute to this repository, please run the following command::

    pre-commit install

This will add a pre-commit hook to automatically style your python code with `black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_.

Because these styling conventions were instituted after multiple releases of
development on this project, ``git blame`` may not reflect the true author
of a given line. In order to see a more accurate ``git blame`` execute the
following command::

    git blame <FILE> --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs

  Or configure your git to always ignore styling revision commits:

    git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs

Unit Testing
------------

Unit tests are written with `py.test <http://doc.pytest.org/>`_ but use
Django fixture loading and convenience testing methods when that makes
things easier.  To run them, first install test requirements (these are
included in dev)::

  pip install -r requirements/test.txt

Run tests using py.test::

  py.test

Visual Testing
--------------

Visual regression tests are written using the Python bindings for Selenium,
and DOM snapshots are uploaded to `Percy <https://percy.io/>`_. They run in CI
on pushes or pull requests to the `develop` branch.

Before visual tests are run, the CI build will execute::

  python manage.py create_test_site

Which uses existing pytest fixtures to populate the database with content
approximating a real website in order to execute the tests. It will then run::

  npm run test:visual

Which starts a Django development server and calls the `ci/visual_tests.py`
script to upload DOM snapshots to Percy for regression analysis.

You can use both of these commands locally if you need to accomplish either of
these tasks. You will need to have the dependencies in `requirements/test.txt`
installed, and set `PERCY_TOKEN` in your shell environment.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation is generated using `sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__
To generate documentation, first install development requirements::

    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt

Then build the documentation using the customized make file in the `docs`
directory::

    cd sphinx-docs
    make html

When building documentation for a production release, use `make docs` to
update the published documentation on GitHub Pages.

On every commit, GitHub Actions will generate and then publish a database diagram to `dbdocs @ princetoncdh/cdh-web <https://dbdocs.io/princetoncdh/cdh-web>`_. But to generate locally, install and log into dbdocs. Then run::

    python manage.py dbml > cdhweb.dbml
    npx dbdocs build cdhweb.dbml --project cdhweb
